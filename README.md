# Mood-Based-Music-Recommendation-system-with-spotify

## 📌 Overview
The **Music-Based Recommendation System** is an AI-powered application that analyzes a user's facial expressions and recommends music that matches or enhances their mood. It integrates with the **Spotify API** to provide a vast and dynamic song library, overcoming the limitations of existing systems with restricted song pools.

## 🎯 Features
- **Facial Emotion Detection**: Uses deep learning to detect facial expressions in real-time.
- **Emotion-to-Genre Mapping**: Assigns genre to each detected emotion for variety.
- **Spotify API Integration**: Fetches songs dynamically, ensuring fresh and diverse playlists.
- **Personalized Music Suggestions**: Recommends songs tailored to the user's mood.


## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning Model**: TensorFlow/Keras (for emotion detection)
- **API Integration**: Spotify API for retrieving music data
- **Programing Language**: Python

## 🏃‍♂️ How It Works
1. The system captures the user's facial expression via a webcam.
2. The trained model predicts the user's emotion (happy, sad, angry, etc.).
3. Based on the detected emotion, the system selects one of three mapped genres.
4. A song from the selected genre is fetched dynamically from Spotify.
5. The recommended song is played via an embedded Spotify player.


## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- **User Preference Learning**: Enhance personalization with user feedback.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Provide music recommendations in different languages.
- **Advanced Emotion Analysis**: Improve accuracy with multi-modal sentiment analysis (text + face + voice).
- **Offline Mode**: Allow song recommendations without an internet connection.
